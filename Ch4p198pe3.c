All years that are evenly divisible by 400 or are evenly divisable by 4 and not evenly by 100 are leap years. Write a C program that accepts the year as a user input, determines if the year is a leap year, and displays an appropriate message that tells the user if the year is or is not a leap year. 

B is to write a program that displays two prompts
"Enter a month (use 1 for Jan, etc.):"
"Enter a day of the month"
us a variable named month for the first prompt, and a variable named day for the second prompt. If the month entered is not between 1 - 12 then an appropriate message should be displayed. If a day is not between 1 - 31 then an appropriate message should be displayed or what is neccessary for the appropriate number of days to the entered month then allecate for leap year.
