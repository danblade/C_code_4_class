Declare a single structure type suitable for a car record consisting of an integer car identification number, an integer value for miles driven by the car, and integer value for the number of gallons used by each car. 
Part B: using the predeclared structure type, write a program that interactively accepts the following data into an array of five structures:
Car number 		Miles Driven 	Gallons Used
25				1,450			62
36				3,240			136
44				1,792			76
52				2,360			105
68				2,114			67

	int id;
	int miles;
	int gallons;
};
